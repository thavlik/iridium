- Providing a rich user experience across all platforms.
    - Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, all of them!
    - **Video game GUIs** (menus, HUDs, etc.)
- Fast and scaleable execution, while reducing runtime memory allocation.
    - Multithreaded rendering
    - Hardware acceleration w/ OpenGL
- Logical and clean separation between data, behavior, and presentation.
    - MVVM-like architecture means more doing, less coding.
