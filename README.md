Iridium UI
=======

Iridium (working title) is a platform-agnostic, general-purpose GUI framework with the goals of:

- Providing a rich user experience across all platforms.
    - Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, all of them!
    - **Video game GUIs** (menus, HUDs, etc.)
- Being both fast and scaleable during runtime.
    - Behavior backend written in C++ 
    - Multithreaded rendering
    - Hardware acceleration w/ OpenGL
- Logically (and cleanly) separating data, behavior, and presentation.
    - MVVM-like architecture means more doing, less coding.
- Allowing designers to have access to intuitive frontend tools.
    - Less coding, more doing!
- Licensed permissibly (currently MIT)
